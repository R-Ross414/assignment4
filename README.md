Assignment 4 - Registrar's Office Simulation

Extra Comment:
For some reason that I could not seem to figure out, the exception handling only worked sometimes. I commented what I wrote originally for exception handling, but the compiler would give the error message that there was multiple redefinitions of differnet exceptions. I checked through the "#include" statements in each file but could not locate the problem.
I also attempted writing a makefile but was unable to get it to work properly, so there is not one included in here.
